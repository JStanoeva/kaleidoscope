# üëë Queen Tora's Royal p5.js Kaleidoscope üé®‚ú®

Welcome, noble visitor, to the repository of Queen Tora's Royal Kaleidoscope! This enchanting digital creation, conjured with the magic of p5.js, transforms simple mouse movements into an ever-evolving tapestry of symmetrical beauty. Prepare to be mesmerized as vibrant lines dance and weave, creating unique patterns with every flick of your wrist! It's a little piece of interactive art designed to bring joy, wonder, and a touch of royal sparkle to your screen. üíñ

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Pattern Generation:** Your mouse is the royal sceptre! Guide it across the canvas to draw intricate, kaleidoscopic designs.
* **Symmetrical Splendor:** Every line you draw is magically mirrored and rotated, creating perfectly balanced and captivating visuals. (Defaulting to 8-fold symmetry for extra dazzle!)
* **Dynamic Rainbow Hues:** Watch as the colors of your creation smoothly transition through the entire spectrum, adding a vibrant, ever-changing dimension to your artwork.
* **Responsive Stroke Weight & Saturation:** The thickness of the lines responds to the speed of your mouse, and colors become more saturated towards the edges, adding depth and dynamism.
* **Fullscreen Majesty:** The kaleidoscope expands to fill your entire browser window, offering an immersive artistic experience.
* **Click to Clear:** Made a masterpiece and ready for another? A simple click clears the canvas, offering a fresh royal blue backdrop for your next inspiration.
* **Responsive Design:** The canvas gracefully adapts if you resize your browser window.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **p5.js:** The core JavaScript library that provides the magical drawing and animation capabilities. (Think of it as our Royal Book of Spells!)
* **HTML5:** Provides the basic structure (the "gallery wall") for the p5.js sketch to be displayed in your browser.
* **CSS (minimal):** A touch of CSS ensures the canvas is truly fullscreen and the page background matches the sketch for a seamless look.
